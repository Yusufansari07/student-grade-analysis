# Student Grade Analysis Tool in C
---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a **Student Grade Analysis Tool** in the C programming language as part of the **DSA Lab (PBL) internal assessment**. It demonstrates essential concepts such as **1D & 2D arrays, loops, conditional statements, functions, bubble-sort logic, and linear search**.

The tool collects student information and performs:

* Total & average calculation
* Grade assignment
* Ranking (topper first)
* Roll-number based search

Perfect for a **3rd-semester DSA mini-project**.

## 🔄 System Workflow

1. User enters number of students and subjects.
2. User inputs: Name, Roll Number, Marks.
3. Program calculates: Total, Average, Grade.
4. Generates a detailed performance report.
5. Sorts students by average for ranking.
6. Searches for a student by roll number.
7. Displays output in formatted tables.
